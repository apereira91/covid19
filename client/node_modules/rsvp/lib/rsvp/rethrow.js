  Promises A+ specifies that any exceptions that occur with a promise must be
  caught by the promises implementation and bubbled to the last handler. For
  this reason, it is recommended that you always specify a second rejection

  handler function to `then`. However, `RSVP.rethrow` will throw the exception

  outside of the promise, so it bubbles up to your console if in the browser,
  or domain/cause uncaught exception in Node. `rethrow` will also throw the
  error again so the error can be handled by the promise per the spec.

  ```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
  import { rethrow } from 'rsvp';

>>>>>>> master
  function throws(){
    throw new Error('Whoops!');
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  let promise = new RSVP.Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    throws();
  });

  promise.catch(RSVP.rethrow).then(function(){
=======
  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    throws();
  });

  promise.catch(rethrow).then(function(){
>>>>>>> master
    // Code here doesn't run because the promise became rejected due to an
    // error!
  }, function (err){
    // handle the error here
  });
  ```

  The 'Whoops' error will be thrown on the next turn of the event loop
  and you can watch for it in your console. You can also handle it using a
  rejection handler given to `.then` or `.catch` on the returned promise.
