/**
<<<<<<< HEAD
 * The "match" callback is used to determine if a `Route` should handle a
 * service worker's `fetch` event. Returning a truthy value means
 * this `Route` will handle and respond to the event.
 *
 * Return `null` if this Route shouldn't match against the `fetch` event.
 *
 * Any truthy value returned by this callback will be passed to the
 * Route's
 * [handler callback]{@link workbox.routing.Route~handlerCallback}.
=======
 * The "match" callback is used to determine if a `Route` should apply for a
 * particular URL. When matching occurs in response to a fetch event from the
 * client, the `event` and `request` objects are supplied in addition to the
 * URL. However, since the match callback can be invoked outside of a fetch
 * event, matching logic should not assume the `event` or `request` objects
 * will always be available (unlike URL, which is always available).
 * If the match callback returns a truthy value, the matching route's
 * [handler callback]{@link workbox.routing.Route~handlerCallback} will be
 * invoked immediately. If the value returned is a non-empty array or object,
 * that value will be set on the handler's `context.params` argument.

 * @param {Object} context

 * @return {Object|null} To signify a match, return anything other than `null`.
