# jest-leak-detector

Module for verifying whether an object has been garbage collected or not.

Internally creates a weak reference to the object, and forces garbage collection to happen. If the reference is gone, it meant no one else was pointing to the object.

## Example

```javascript
let reference = {};

const detector = new LeakDetector(reference);

// Reference is held in memory.
<<<<<<< HEAD
console.log(detector.isLeaked()); // true
=======
console.log(detector.isLeaking()); // true
>>>>>>> master

// We destroy the only reference to the object.
reference = null;

// Reference is gone.
<<<<<<< HEAD
console.log(detector.isLeaked()); // false
=======
console.log(detector.isLeaking()); // false
>>>>>>> master
```
