ESLint couldn't find the plugin "<%- pluginName %>". This can happen for a couple different reasons:

1. If ESLint is installed globally, then make sure <%- pluginName %> is also installed globally. A globally-installed ESLint cannot find a locally-installed plugin.

2. If ESLint is installed locally, then it's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm i <%- pluginName %>@latest --save-dev

Path to ESLint package: <%- eslintPath %>
